    Arraylist
        allow duplicates
        allow multiple null values
        List is an ordered collection, List's contract maintains insertion order or element.


    Set
        does not allow duplicates
        allow single null values
        Set is an unordered collection, you get no guarantee on which order element will be stored.

    Map
        stores two objects key and value.
        map key not allowed null values key allow duplicates
        HashMap doesn't provide any ordering guarantee.
